# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews (40 points)

Using your knowledge of the cloud ETL process, youâ€™ll create an AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin, pick a dataset from the Amazon Review datasets, and extract the dataset into a DataFrame.

4.	Download the challenge_schema.sql file to your computer.

5.	In pgAdmin, run a new query to create the tables for your new database using the code from the challenge_schema.sql file.
  o	After you run the query, you should have the following four tables in your database: customers_table, products_table, review_id_table, and vine_table.
